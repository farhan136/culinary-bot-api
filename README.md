# Culinary Bot (Telegram & RESTful API)

A RESTful API project built with Laravel, powering a Telegram bot designed to help users find restaurant information, including addresses, menus, and reviews. This project integrates with the Google Places API for culinary data and utilizes various modern web development practices.

**ðŸš§ PROJECT IN PROGRESS ðŸš§**
Please note that this project is currently under active development. While core functionalities are in place, some features and documentation sections are still being finalized.

## Features

* **Telegram Bot Integration:** Responds to various message types (text, location, contact, etc.) for interactive restaurant search.
* **Restaurant Search:** Finds restaurants based on user queries or shared locations using the Google Places API.
* **Detailed Information:** Provides comprehensive details for a selected restaurant, including address, phone, website, rating, opening hours, and reviews.
* **API Request Logging:** Automatically records metadata (method, URL, headers, body, IP, user agent, status code, response body, timestamps) for every API request.
* **API Log Display:** Endpoint to view recorded API metadata.
* **Authentication & 2FA (Planned):** Secure RESTful API endpoints using Laravel Passport with Two-Factor Authentication capabilities. **(Future enhancement)**
* **PostgreSQL Database:** All application data is stored in a robust PostgreSQL database.
* **Design Pattern Implementation:** Utilizes various design patterns for a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase (e.g., Service, Middleware).
* **Git Versioning Control with CI/CD (Planned):** Managed with Git, with a future plan for CI/CD integration. **(Future enhancement)**

## Technology Stack

* **Framework:** Laravel (PHP)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **API Integration:**
    * Telegram Bot API
    * Google Places API (for restaurant data, as an alternative to Zomato API which is deprecated/not publicly accessible)
* **Authentication:** Laravel Passport (OAuth2 & JWT)
* **External Tooling:** Expose (for local development tunneling)

## Project Structure & Design Patterns

The project follows a modular and clean architecture, implementing several design patterns:

* **Service Pattern (`app/Services`):**
    * `BotInteractionService`: Handles the core logic for Telegram bot interactions (sending messages, parsing commands, handling various message types).
    * `GooglePlacesService`: Encapsulates all logic related to interacting with the Google Places API, keeping API calls and data parsing separated.
* **Middleware Pattern (`app/Http/Middleware/ApiRequestLogger.php`):**
    * `ApiRequestLogger`: Intercepts incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses to automatically log request metadata to the database, ensuring separation of concerns for logging.
* **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** Standard Laravel structure is adhered to, with dedicated `Controllers`, `Models`, and `Routes`.
    * `app/Http/Controllers/TelegramWebhookController`: Receives and dispatches Telegram webhook updates.
    * `app/Http/Controllers/ApiLogController`: Manages the display of recorded API logs.
    * `app/Models/ApiLog`: Eloquent model for the `api_logs` table.
    * `app/Models/User`: Eloquent model for user management, integrated with Laravel Passport and 2FA.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your project up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

* PHP >= 8.2
* Composer
* Node.js & NPM (for frontend assets, if any are added, but not strictly required for backend/bot)
* PostgreSQL Database Server
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git) # Replace with your actual repo
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install Composer dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  **Generate Application Key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

### Database Setup

1.  **Create a PostgreSQL database** for your project (e.g., `culinary_bot_db`).
2.  **Configure `.env`** (see next section) with your database credentials.
3.  **Run Migrations:**
    This command will drop all existing tables and run all migrations from scratch, ensuring your database schema is up-to-date.
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate:fresh
    ```
    *Note: If you plan to seed initial data (e.g., a default user), you can use `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.*
4.  **Install Laravel Passport:**
    ```bash
    php artisan passport:install
    ```
    This will create the necessary encryption keys and OAuth clients. Keep the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` it generates for Postman testing.

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
